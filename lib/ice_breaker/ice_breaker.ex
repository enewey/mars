  Ice Breaker game core.

  IceBreaker is a game on a 6x6 grid of blocks, upon which sits a penguin.
  The penguin occupies a 2x2 space on the grid, and their space is counted
  as a single block.
  All other blocks surrounding are single 1x1 blocks.

  The idea of the game is players take turns removing blocks from the
  game. Every block that is removed reduces the stability of surrounding blocks.

  A block is "stable" if all other cells either in the same row or same column
  are occupied by a block.
